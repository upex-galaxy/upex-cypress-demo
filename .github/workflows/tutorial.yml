name: Tutorial YML File # Optional - The name of the workflow as it will appear in the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository
run-name: CI Run Example by ${{github.actor}} # Optional - The name for workflow runs generated from the workflow, which will appear in the list of workflow runs on your repository's "Actions" tab. This example uses an expression with the github context to display the username of the actor that triggered the workflow run. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#run-name

on: [push] # Specifies the trigger for this workflow. This example uses the push event, so a workflow run is triggered every time someone pushes a change to the repository or merges a pull request. This is triggered by a push to every branch; for examples of syntax that runs only on pushes to specific branches, paths, or tags, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpull_request_targetpathspaths-ignore

jobs: # Groups together all the jobs that run in the "Galaxy CI" workflow.
  VERIFY-CYPRESS-VERSION: # Defines a job named "VERIFY CYPRESS VERSION". The child keys will define properties of the job.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Configures the job to run on the latest version of an Ubuntu Linux runner. This means that the job will execute on a fresh virtual machine hosted by GitHub. For syntax examples using other runners, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on
    steps: # Groups together all the steps that run in the "VERIFY CYPRESS VERSION" job. Each item nested under this section is a separate action or shell script.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # The uses keyword specifies that this step will run v3 of the actions/checkout action. This is an action that checks out your repository onto the runner, allowing you to run scripts or other actions against your code (such as build and test tools). You should use the checkout action any time your workflow will run against the repository's code.
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3 #This step uses the actions/setup-node@v3 action to install the specified version of the Node.js (this example uses v14). This puts both the node and npm commands in your PATH.
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      - run: npm install -g cypress # The run keyword tells the job to execute a command on the runner. In this case, you are using npm to install the bats software testing package.

      - run: cypress --version # Finally, In this case, you'll run the cypress version command that outputs the software version.
