Description
As a QA learner,

I want to test the Dynamic Properties WHEN:

Element has Dynamic ID in DOM

Element is enable after 5 sec

Element is visible after 5 sec

Element CSS color is changed

So that I can improve my testing skills for this scenario.

✅ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This feature doesn’t need BDD AC - Please take a look into the BRS

🚩BUSINESS RULES SPEC

Elements:
“This text has random Id“

For Element: Dynamic ID, QA should validate getting the element without using “text“ (contains text)

ID is generic and with every reload the id is changed, so:
How to get an element if the ID is dynamic, and it doesn’t have class, names, or any other attribute?

“Will enable 5 seconds“

The element should be asserted before and after is enabled.

“Color Change“

The element should be asserted before and after the color is changed.
PD: there’s no any CSS color property assigned to the element, but class name instead.

“Visible After 5 Seconds“

the element should be asserted before and after is visible.
