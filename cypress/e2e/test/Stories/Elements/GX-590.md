[GX-590](https://upexgalaxy1.atlassian.net/browse/GX-590) Created: 9/19/22 Updated: 9/20/22

*   As a QA learner,
*   I want to test the **checkboxes** with:
    *   Expand All
    *   Collapse All
    *   Each toggle
    *   Each checkbox
*   So that I can improve my testing skills for this scenario.

Bulk Action:

Expand All: it must expand all of the folders

Collapse All: it must close all of the folders

The Toggle Folder Structure must be like this:

Home

Desktop

Notes

Commands

Documents

WorkSpace

React

Angular

Veu

Office

Public

Private

Classified

General

Downloads

Word File.doc

Excel File.doc

Each Checkbox must autocheck the inner one:

Example:

when “Desktop” checkbox is checked:

Notes must be checked

Commands must be checked

The Success-Message that it must be displayed below the Toggles content:

IF: The Label is selected

THEN: The Label Name is displayed in the Success-Message as green
