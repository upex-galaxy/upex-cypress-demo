[GX-610](https://upexgalaxy1.atlassian.net/browse/GX-610) Created: 9/20/22 Updated: 9/20/22

*   As a QA learner,
*   I want to test:
    *   **filling out a form** **with**:
        *   Full Name
        *   Email
        *   Current Address
        *   Permanent Address
    *   **And Submit it**.
*   So that I can improve my testing skills for this scenario.

For: “Full Name”, “Current Address” and “Permanent Address”

These fields can be empty or filled.

IF field is empty = No log message is displayed after submitting.

For: “Email”

This field can be invalid, empty or filled.

This field is invalid when:

Does not contain (minimum) 2 alphanumeric characters after “.”

Mockup: “x@x.xx”

IF field is invalid = class="mr-sm-2 field-error form-control" is displayed as a red border.

IF field is empty = No log message is displayed after submitting.

IF field is filled = String is displayed below as a paragraph after submitting
