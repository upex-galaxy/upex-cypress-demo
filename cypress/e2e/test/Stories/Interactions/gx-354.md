*   As a QA learner,
*   I want to test:
    *   **Click Button to see alert.**
    *   **On button click, alert will appear after 5 seconds.**
    *   **On button click, confirm box will appear.**
    *   **On button click, prompt box will appear.**
*   So that I can improve my testing skills for this scenario.
