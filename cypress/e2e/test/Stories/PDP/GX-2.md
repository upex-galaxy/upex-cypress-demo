# Labs: CI Framework Test for Xray with Cypress and GitHub Actions

[GX-2](https://upexgxydraft.atlassian.net/browse/GX-2) Created: 7/14/22 Updated: 7/23/22

As a Workspace Manager,

I want to test Cypress-GitHub TX Result Integration; by clicking on a Jira Action, the CI tool can be triggered and run all of the associated test to this feature and update the test status back to Jira again.

So that the Tests can be updated from Jira Action.
