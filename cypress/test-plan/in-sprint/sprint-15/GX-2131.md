As a QA learner,

I want to test:

So that I can improve my testing skills for this scenario.

Challenge:

QA Deberá realizar pruebas e2e con el uso de POM (Page Object Model)
QA Deberá de usar la dependencia de drag-and-drop y deberá de usar coordenadas aleatorias.

Scope del challenge:
Aprender a obtener elementos;
Aprender a mover elementos dentro del DOM;
Pulir nuestro uso de POM;
