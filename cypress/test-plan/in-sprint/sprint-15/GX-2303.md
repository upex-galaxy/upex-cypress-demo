As a QA learner,

I want to test:

Add a register with:
First name
Last name
Email
Age
Salary
Department

Filter a register search by field.

Ordering a register.

Edit a register.

Remove a register.

Perform a registers pagination by rows number.

And moving between the paginations by: 
the “previous” button.
the “next” button.
the “page” field.

So that I can improve my testing skill for this scenario.
