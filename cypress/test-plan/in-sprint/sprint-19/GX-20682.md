As a QA learner,

I want to test:

filling out a form with:

Full Name

Email

Current Address

Permanent Address

And Submit it.

So that I can improve my testing skills for this scenario.

Test Analysis

For: “Full Name”, “Current Address” and “Permanent Address”

These fields can be empty or filled.

IF field is empty = No log message is displayed after submitting.

IF field is filled = String is displayed below as a paragraph after submitting.

For: “Email”

This field can be invalid, empty or filled.

This field is invalid when:

Does not contain “@”

Does not contain (minimum) 1 alphanumeric character before “@”

Does not contain (minimum) 1 alphanumeric character after “@”

Does not contain “.” after: 1 alphanumeric character after “@”.

Does not contain (minimum) 2 alphanumeric characters after “.”

Mockup: “x@x.xx”

IF field is invalid = class="mr-sm-2 field-error form-control" is displayed as a red border.

IF field is empty = No log message is displayed after submitting.

IF field is filled = String is displayed below as a paragraph after submitting.
