# ⚡️ToolsQA | Elements | Dynamic Properties

[GX3-1612](https://upexgalaxy34.atlassian.net/browse/GX3-1612) Created: 22/1/24 Updated: 22/1/24

-   As a QA learner,
-   I want to test the **Dynamic Properties WHEN**:
    -   Element has Dynamic ID in DOM
    -   Element is enable after 5 sec
    -   Element is visible after 5 sec
    -   Element CSS color is changed
-   So that I can improve my testing skills for this scenario.

````Elements: “This text has random Id“

For Element: Dynamic ID, QA should validate getting the element without using “text“ (contains text)

ID is generic and with every reload the id is changed, so: How to get an element if the ID is dynamic, and it doesn’t have class, names, or any other
attribute?

“Will enable 5 seconds“

The element should be asserted before and after is enabled.

“Color Change“

The element should be asserted before and after the color is changed. PD: there’s no any CSS color property assigned to the element, but class name
instead.

“Visible After 5 Seconds“

the element should be asserted before and after is visible.```
